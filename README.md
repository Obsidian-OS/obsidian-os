# ObsidianOS
> Turning [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) into an OS
## Why?
Multiple reasons:
1. Repurposing an old MacBook
2. Obsidian is cool
3. Arch is cool
4. I've been wanting to build a Wayland compositor for a while
5. I get distracted easily, so having a computer that can't do anything else is perfect for my upcoming tertiary education
## How?
ObsidianOS is based on Arch Linux running a custom Wayland compostior. Plugins give the necessary functionality to Obsidian for a functional machine.
* Wayland compositor
* System Control (Power, Display, Volume, Network, Bluetooth, Keyboard Layout, Updates)
* Terminal
* Browser
* Notification panel
# Where do I try it out?
You can't. Yet. I haven't started on this project yet (as you can tell by the very empty repo)
My goal is to provide 3 things:
1. The source code, so you can build it on your own, make customisations to it etc.
2. Prebuilt images
3. A script for turning a fresh Arch install into ObsidianOS
