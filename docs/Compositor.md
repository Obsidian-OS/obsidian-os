The Wayland Compositor powering the system is built in Rust with [Smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay). It will launch Obsidian on its own and display it in fullscreen mode. Any other clients connecting to the compositor will be buffered off-screen, and a notification sent along a socket. A plugin running in Obsidian monitors this socket and places the frame in an obsidian tab, updating it according to the instructions given by the compositor.
